#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) 0 < 8
a = 4 + 4

answer = 0(n) also known as linear

b)

answer = 0(n log n) also known as linearithmic

c) 

answer = 0(n) also known as linear

## Exercise II

purpose = what is the value of f?

building_story = input of n
eggs = (anonymous)
floor f = input of f
floor = (which should track what floor we are on)

for floors in story building:
    if floor >= floor_f:
        eggs get broken
    else:
